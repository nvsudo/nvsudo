## Hi there 👋

I'm Nik Vora, working in my free time on agents, agent-to-agent interactions, and automating things I should have done manually anyways. 

- 💬 Ask me about: Enterprise Sales, International Markets, Product strategy, Growth stage revenue and pmf hacking, agent and LLM hacks 
- ⚡ Fun fact: Building prediction trees about how education, employment, politics, search, and other human functions will work in an agent era. Staying ahead in the worry and paranoia game !
